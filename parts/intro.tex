\section{Introduction} 

	\emph{Answer set programming} (ASP) is a form of declarative programming that has been successively used in many knowledge representation and
	reasoning tasks \cite{DBLP:journals/amai/Niemela99,Baral03,DBLP:conf/iclp/Baral08}.
	In ASP, a problem is represented by a logic program where the answer sets correspond to the solutions of the problem.
	Solving the problem is then reduced to computing stable models using answer set solvers like \emph{clasp} \cite{DBLP:conf/lpnmr/GebserKNS07a,gebser2008user}.
